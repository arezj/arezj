# Hi, I'm Arez!

I build across AI, fintech, and healthcare.  

My work encompasses payment infrastructure, AI-driven platforms, and tools that enable independent businesses to thrive.  My go-to stack is  Python, TypeScript, React, and PostgreSQL. On the architecture side, I'm a huge believer in DDD and Hexagonal Architecture. The beauty of a carefully orchestrated dependency inversion is something one must experience to truly appreciate.

## Current Focus
- Building innovative fintech products. 
- Exploring the intersection of healthcare and AI.  

## Pinned Projects
Open source work Iâ€™m exploring to both help guide my own work and see how I can contribute to broader innovation:
- [agentic-payments](#)  | One of the most impactful steps towards enabling AI to participate in the physical economy and thus enter consumers' everyday lives.
- [medplum](#)  | Brings healthcare into the modern developer ecosystem by making data interoperable and lowering the barrier towards responsibly building in this highly regulated space.
